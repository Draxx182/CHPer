# CHPer
A temporary solution for unpacking JE/LJ hact.chp

# How to Use
1. Extract talk_param.bin with [reARMP](https://github.com/CapitanRetraso/reARMP)
2. Ensure that talk_param.bin.json is in the same directory as the original hact.chp
3. Drag and drop hact.chp onto CHPer.exe
4. Open hact.json with Notepad++
5. Make any edits you need to do
6. Repack hact.json by dragging and dropping onto CHPer.exe
7. Rename 'hact new.chp' to 'hact.chp'

# Talk param
talk_param.bin ALSO needs to be edited in order for a new heat action entry to be recognized.
Follow the same format as other entries in talk_param, update the name and bin count.
